A man in a yellow hooded sweatshirt and jeans is standing on the roof of the van, looking out at the view of the mountain range. The sky is a deep blue, dotted with fluffy white clouds. To the right of the man, a large brown backpack is draped over the vans head. The mountain range is covered in snow, adding to the authenticity of the image.'
